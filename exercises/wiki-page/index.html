    <h3>Crown shyness</h3>

   <p> <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> canopy 
    shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing <sup>[3]</sup> </i>) is a
     phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully 
     stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like 
     gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the
     same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.
     <sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness
     is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread
      of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup></p>

     <p> The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
     <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature 
     since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental
     results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across 
     different species, an example of convergent evolution.[citation needed]</p>
